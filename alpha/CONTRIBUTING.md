# Contributing

Please use feature branches for further development of the project. In order to get one's changes merged,
we mostly use GitHub's pull request feature. However, sending changes via mail to one of the maintainers
is possible.

## Pull Requests

 1. Pull requests must have at least one reviewer.
 2. Do not merge your own pull requests, wait for one of your reviewers to do that.
 3. In case no reviewer shows any activity for one week, you might choose different reviewers. Only in
    case there is no suitable and active reviewer you may disregard rule (2.).
