Hello everyone,

The next PhD seminar will be presented by Bryan Garreau. Here's a little abstract of his presentation :

Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a new paradigm that aims to combine Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Constraint Programming (CP). This new language is supposed to take the best of both worlds in terms of resolution techniques and modelisation. CASP is fairly new and combining the two isn't as simple as it seems. In this seminar I will briefly explain what are the benefits of this new language and why fusing the two is so complicated.

As usual, it will take place in G208 or G203. The presentation will also be streamed live on discord for those who cannot be there but still want to see the presentation.
