  author={Beldiceanu, N. and Carlsson, M.},
  booktitle={CP 2002},
  pages={63--79},
  year={2002},
  abstract = "This paper presents a new cumulatives constraint, which generalizes the original cumulative constraint in different ways. The two most important aspects consist in permitting multiple cumulative resources as well as negative heights for the resource consumption of the tasks. This allows modeling in an easy way workload covering, producer-consumer, and scheduling problems. The introduction of negative heights has forced us to come up with new filtering algorithms and to revisit existing ones. The first filtering algorithm is derived from an idea called sweep, which is extensively used in computational geometry; the second algorithm is based on a combination of sweep and constructive disjunction; while the last is a generalization of task intervals to this new context. A real-life crew scheduling problem originally motivated this constraint which was implemented within the SICStus finite domain solver and evaluated against different problem patterns.",

abstract = "At universities, the timetable plays a large role in the daily life of students and staff, showing when and where lectures are given. But whenever a schedule is executed in a dynamic environment, disruptions will occur. It is then desirable to find a new timetable similar to the old one, so only a few people will be affected. This leads to a minimum perturbation problem, where the goal is to find a feasible timetable by changing as few assignments as possible. This solution will, however, often lead to timetables of low quality as it can have many undesired features that will cause much inconvenience for effected parties. In this paper we show that minimum perturbation solutions often have low quality and how using additional perturbations results in timetables with significantly higher quality while still keeping the number of perturbations low, so the solutions can be practically implemented. We formulate a bi-objective model and propose a method to solve it by using mixed integer programming. We test the method on standard instances of the Curriculum-based Course Timetabling Problem with four different types of disruptions. The use of bi-objective optimization enables us to generate multiple solutions whereby we provide the decision makers with multiple choices for handling the disruption. This allows the decision makers to determine the best trade-off between the number of perturbations and the quality, ultimately leading to better timetables for students and staff when disruptions occur."

abstract="Constraint-Based Local Search emerged in the last decade as a framework for declaratively expressing hard combinatorial optimization problems and solve them with local search techniques. It delivers tools to practitioners that enables them to quickly experiment with multiple models, heuristics, and meta-heuristics, focusing on their application rather than the delicate minutiae of producing a competitive implementation. At its heart, the declarative models are reminiscent of the modeling facilities familiar to constraint programming, while the underlying computational model heavily depends on incrementality. The net result is a platform capable of delivering competitive local search solutions at a fraction of the efforts needed with a conventional approach delivering model-and-run to local search users.",

LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of ``related'' customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems",

QCSP offers a natural framework to express PSPACE problems as finite two-players games. But to define a QCSP model, the binder must be formerly known and cannot be built dynamically even if the worst case won{\textquoteright}t occur. To overcome this issue, we define the new QCHR formalism that allows to build the binder dynamically during the solving. Our QCHR models exhibit state-of-the-art performances on static binder and outperforms previous QCSP approaches when the binder is dynamic.</p>},

It is a very hard combinatorial optimisation problem which attracts the interest of many researchers. The university course timetabling problem (UCTTP) is difficult to address due to the size of the problem and several challenging hard and soft constraints. Over the years, various methodologies were proposed to solve UCTTP. The purpose of this survey paper is to provide the most recent scientific review of the methodologies applied to UCTTP. The paper unveils a classification of methodologies proposed in recent years based on chronology and datasets used. Perspectives, trends, challenges and opportunities in UCTTP are also presented. It is observed that meta-heuristic approaches are popular among researchers. This is followed closely by hybrid methodologies. Hyper-heuristic approaches are also able to produce effective results. Another observation is that the state-of-art methodologies in the scientific literature are not fully utilised in a real-world environment perhaps due to the limited flexibility of these methodologies.},

Generally, researchers present different features to signify their own universities’ timetable according to the structure and behavior of their institution. However, the gap between theory and real-world applications that can be seen in the resulted timetable is the lacking of acknowledging human preferences. As to overcome this, it is very important to consider all the demands and preferences from timetabling community. This research therefore tries to accommodate the problem by investigating through surveys to several universities in the east coast of Malaysia the demands and preferences of individuals involved directly. Results from the questionnaires will be analyzed by using SPSS and all current issues regarding the demands will be included into our existing general university course timetabling mathematical model. The new university course timetabling mathematical model could best represent universities and be useful, especially in universities in Malaysia.},

Hyper-heuristics have been successfully applied to a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This is a rapidly growing field which aims at providing generalized solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by exploring a heuristic space instead of a solution space. From the research conducted thus far it is evident that hyper-heuristics are effective at solving educational timetabling problems and have the potential of advancing this field by providing a generalized solution to educational timetabling as a whole. Given this, the paper provides an overview and critical analysis of hyper-heuristics for educational timetabling and proposes future research directions, focusing on using hyper-heuristics to provide a generalized solution to educational timetabling.},

Constructing an effective timetable is always a challenging task for any scheduler. Most literature research focuses on specific applications and the resulting models are not easily applied to problems other than those for which they were designed for. In this paper, we construct a general model for university course timetabling. Our model incorporates a total of 17 different types of requirements identified in the literature as well as three new constraint types that we think should be part of the restrictions in a general university based timetabling model. An integer programming (IP) model is presented which incorporates restrictions that need to be satisfied and requests that are included in the objective function. We implement and test our models using the AIMMS mathematical software package. Computational results on a number of case studies are favorable and demonstrate the value of our approach.},

We formulate the problem as a mathematical programming model. Two diﬀerent algorithms, mainly based on simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) algorithms, are proposed for solving the problem. The proposed algorithms consist of two phases. The ﬁrst phase involves allocating the teachers to the courses and determining the number of courses to be assigned to each teacher. The second phase involves assigning the teachers to the course sections in order to balance the teachers’ load. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using two sets of real data and some randomly generated problem instances. The computational results show that in general, tabu search performs better than simulated annealing and other previous work. For the real data sets, the computational results show that both proposed algorithms yield better solutions when compared to manual allocation done by the university.},

Variables of the underlying mathematical model correspond to daily teacher schedules while a number of hard and soft constraints are included so as for the model to handle practical aspects that manifest themselves in Greek High Schools. By selecting better teacher schedules that exist in sub- problems the quality of the overall solution gradually improves.

	abstract = {The Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem (BACP) consists in assigning courses to teaching terms satisfying prerequisites and balancing the credit course load within each term. The BACP is part of the CSPLib with three benchmark instances, but its formulation is simpler than the problem solved in practice by universities. In this article, we introduce a generalized version of the problem that takes different curricula and professor preferences into account, and we provide a set of real-life problem instances arisen at University of Udine. Since the existing formulation based on a min–max objective function does not balance effectively the credit load for the new instances, we also propose alternative objective functions. Whereas all the CSPLib instances are efficiently solved with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) state-of-the-art solvers, our new set of real-life instances turns out to be much more challenging and still intractable for ILP solvers. Therefore, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed heuristics based on local search. We have collected computational results on all the new instances with the proposed approaches and assessed the quality of solutions with respect to the lower bounds found by ILP on a relaxed and decomposed problem. Results show that a selected heuristic finds solutions of quality at 9\%–60\% distance from the lower bound. We make all data publicly available, in order to stimulate further research on this problem.},

We focus on how to dispatch the students into sections of equal size, so as to minimize the number of edges in the resulting conflict graph. As a main result, we show that subdividing the students set in a regular way is optimal. We then discuss our solution uniqueness and feasibility, as well as practical issues concerning teacher assignments to sections and the case of an additional course with unequal section sizes requirements.",

abstract = {In this work, we are addressing the post enrollment course timetabling (PE-CTT) problem. We combine different local search algorithms into an iterative two stage procedure. In the first stage, Tabu Search with Sampling and Perturbation (TSSP) is used to generate feasible solutions. In the second stage, we propose an improved variant of Simulated Annealing (SA), which we call Simulated Annealing with Reheating (SAR), to improve the solution quality of feasible solutions. SAR has three features: a novel neighborhood examination scheme, a new way of estimating local optima and a reheating scheme. SAR eliminates the need for extensive tuning as is often required in conventional SA. The proposed methodologies are tested on the three most studied datasets from the scientific literature. Our algorithms perform well and our results are competitive, if not better, compared to the benchmarks set by the state of the art methods. New best known results are provided for many instances.},

The problem is solved every year by many universities, each having its own specific set of constraints. In this work, we study the tutor allocation in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, and solve it with an integer linear programming model. We tested the model on the 2019/2020 case, obtaining a significant improvement with respect to the manual assignment in use and we showed that such improvement could be maintained while optimizing other key metrics such as load balance among groups of tutors and total number of courses assigned. Further tests on randomly created instances show that the model can be used to address cases of broad interest. We also provide meaningful insights on how input parameters, such as the number of workshop locations and the length of the tutors’ preference list, might affect the performance of the model and the average number of preferences satisfied.},

title = {Disruptions in Timetables: A Case Study at Universidade de Lisboa},
journal = {Journal of Scheduling},
doi = {10.1007/s10951-020-00666-3},
abstract = {Solving university course timetabling problems is a large and complex task. Moreover, every new academic term, a new
timetable is likely to be scheduled due to disruptions (e.g., changes in teacher-lecture allocation). Nevertheless, the university
infrastructure, the overall curricular plans, and the number of students/teachers is still very similar in consecutive terms. For
this reason, a timetable does not need to be always scheduled from scratch since it can produce a completely different solution
from the previous one, thus creating undesirable changes for many actors. This paper addresses the Minimal Perturbation
Problem (MPP) in university course timetabling. Given a set of disruptions that make a timetable no longer feasible, a solution
to the MPP is the closest new feasible timetable with respect to the original timetable. We propose and analyze two different
integer programming models to encode the MPP. To validate the proposed models, disruptions are randomly generated based
on the probability distributions learned from the history of timetables over the last five years in the Instituto Superior Técnico
(IST) the engineering school from Universidade de Lisboa. Overall, our models, combined with an incremental approach, are
shown to be able to efficiently solve all problem instances.},
