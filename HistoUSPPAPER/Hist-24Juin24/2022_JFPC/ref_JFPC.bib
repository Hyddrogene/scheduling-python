abstract = "At universities, the timetable plays a large role in the daily life of students and staff, showing when and where lectures are given. But whenever a schedule is executed in a dynamic environment, disruptions will occur. It is then desirable to find a new timetable similar to the old one, so only a few people will be affected. This leads to a minimum perturbation problem, where the goal is to find a feasible timetable by changing as few assignments as possible. This solution will, however, often lead to timetables of low quality as it can have many undesired features that will cause much inconvenience for effected parties. In this paper we show that minimum perturbation solutions often have low quality and how using additional perturbations results in timetables with significantly higher quality while still keeping the number of perturbations low, so the solutions can be practically implemented. We formulate a bi-objective model and propose a method to solve it by using mixed integer programming. We test the method on standard instances of the Curriculum-based Course Timetabling Problem with four different types of disruptions. The use of bi-objective optimization enables us to generate multiple solutions whereby we provide the decision makers with multiple choices for handling the disruption. This allows the decision makers to determine the best trade-off between the number of perturbations and the quality, ultimately leading to better timetables for students and staff when disruptions occur."

abstract="Constraint-Based Local Search emerged in the last decade as a framework for declaratively expressing hard combinatorial optimization problems and solve them with local search techniques. It delivers tools to practitioners that enables them to quickly experiment with multiple models, heuristics, and meta-heuristics, focusing on their application rather than the delicate minutiae of producing a competitive implementation. At its heart, the declarative models are reminiscent of the modeling facilities familiar to constraint programming, while the underlying computational model heavily depends on incrementality. The net result is a platform capable of delivering competitive local search solutions at a fraction of the efforts needed with a conventional approach delivering model-and-run to local search users.",

abstract="We use a local search method we term Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) to solve vehicle routing problems. LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of ``related'' customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems",

abstract= "University course timetabling problem (UCTP)has become a well-known study among universities and researchers for various fields. Generally, UCTP is the allocation of events into timeslots and rooms considering the list of hard and soft constraints presented in one semester, so that no conflict is created in such  allocations. Hard constraints should not be violated under any conditions while satisfying as much as possible the soft constraints. We review and classified all the constraints from the literature. Variety constraints used in previous study of timetabling problem. Although improvements on the features have been done since the automation approached was first introduced in the 1960’s, we restrict our review only within the last ten years. More features reflecting the timetabling communities were being identified recently. Based on the review and through our thorough analysis, we have managed to compile mostly used features in researchers model to introduce a more general mathematical model. Seven new constraints, which cover requirements related to class meeting pattern and preferences from timetabling communities, were added in our general mathematical model developed in previous study"

The decision problem is to assign these teaching groups to time slots and rooms so that several soft and hard constraints are met. It is modeled as an assignment problem with numerous types of constraints and about 100,000 binary or integer variables. An open source mixed-integer solver can be used to solve the problem to optimality within minutes whereas the commercial CPLEX solver takes only seconds. We also describe the implementation process and report results from an anonymous satisfaction survey among the faculty with respect to the new planning approach."

In particular, we focus our attention on the formulation known as the curriculum-based course timetabling problem (CB-CTT), which has been tackled by many researchers and for which there are many available benchmarks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose an effective and robust single-stage simulated annealing method for solving the problem. Second, we design and apply an extensive and statistically-principled methodology for the parameter tuning procedure. The outcome of this analysis is a methodology for modeling the relationship between search method parameters and instance features that allows us to set the parameters for unseen instances on the basis of a simple inspection of the instance itself. Using this methodology, our algorithm, despite its apparent simplicity, has been able to achieve high quality results on a set of popular benchmarks. A final contribution of the paper is a novel set of real-world instances, which could be used as a benchmark for future comparison."

    abstract="In this paper we present a general integer programming-based approach for the minimal perturbation problem in university course timetabling. This problem arises when an existing timetable contains hard constraint violations, or infeasibilities, which need to be resolved. The objective is to resolve these infeasibilities while minimising the disruption or perturbation to the remainder of the timetable. This situation commonly occurs in practical timetabling, for example when there are unexpected changes to course enrolments or available rooms. Our method attempts to resolve each infeasibility in the smallest neighbourhood possible, and utilises the exactness of integer programming. Operating within a neighbourhood of minimal size keeps the computations fast, and does not permit large movements of course events, which cause widespread disruption to timetable structure. We demonstrate the application of this method using an example based on real data from the University of Auckland."

Most literature research focuses on specific applications and the resulting models are not easily applied to problems other than those for which they were designed for. In this paper, we construct a general model for university course timetabling. Our model incorporates a total of 17 different types of requirements identified in the literature as well as three new constraint types that we think should be part of the restrictions in a general university based timetabling model. An integer programming (IP) model is presented which incorporates restrictions that need to be satisfied and requests that are included in the objective function. We implement and test our models using the AIMMS mathematical software package. Computational results on a number of case studies are favorable and demonstrate the value of our approach."

The approach is validated using real data from the first semester of year 2012. Results show that the proposed approach obtains a better utilization of classrooms satisfying both hard and soft constraints of the original problem. A sensitivity analysis is finally carried out, in which it was possible to verify the possibility of reducing both the number of classrooms to be assigned and the number of course groups.

Additionally, the MS makes groups of courses without interference in the curricula in order to eliminate this constraint of the Integer Programming (IP) model. Then, we present a comprehensive IP model, which use a set of complex constraints, e.g., professor’s availability, consider the course modality in order to assign an appropriate room, consecutive and isolated period of the courses, among others. Also, consider the constraint that ensures do not cancel courses of interest due to parallel assignments of the mandatory courses. With this methodology was possible to assign 2101 lectures and improve the efficiency of the current scheduling process."

In this paper, a new hybrid method which is a combination of a great deluge and artificial bee colony algorithm (INMGD-ABC) is proposed to address the university timetabling problem. Artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is a population based method that has been introduced in recent years and has proven successful in solving various optimization problems effectively. However, as with many search based approaches, there exist weaknesses in the exploration and exploitation abilities which tend to induce slow convergence of the overall search process. Therefore, hybridization is proposed to compensate for the identified weaknesses of the ABC. Also, inspired from imperialist competitive algorithms, an assimilation policy is implemented in order to improve the global exploration ability of the ABC algorithm. In addition, Nelder–Mead simplex search method is incorporated within the great deluge algorithm (NMGD) with the aim of enhancing the exploitation ability of the hybrid method in fine-tuning the problem search region. The proposed method is tested on two differing benchmark datasets i.e. examination and course timetabling datasets. A statistical analysis t-test has been conducted and shows the performance of the proposed approach as significantly better than basic ABC algorithm. Finally, the experimental results are compared against state-of-the art methods in the literature, with results obtained that are competitive and in certain cases achieving some of the current best results to those in the literature."

This problem has been tackled using metaheuristics techniques. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been successfully used for tackling uncapaciated examination and course timetabling problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid ABC algorithm based on the integrated technique is proposed for tackling the university course timetabling problem. First of all, initial feasible solutions are generated using the combination of saturation degree (SD) and backtracking algorithm (BA). Secondly, a hill climbing optimizer is embedded within the employed bee operator to enhance the local exploitation ability of the original ABC algorithm while tackling the problem. Hill climbing iteratively navigates the search space of each population member in order to reach a local optima. The proposed hybrid ABC technique is evaluated using the dataset established by Socha including five small, five medium and one large problem instances. Empirical results on these problem instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Our work also shows that a well-designed hybrid technique is a competitive alternative for addressing the university course timetabling problem."

It is an open ended problem in which courses must be arranged around a set  of timeslots and venues so that some constraints are satisfied.

The main objective of the research is to solve this problem by using modified Genetic Algorithms approach. The implementation of the timetabling problem was characterized by crossover, mutation and selection scheme modifications with the introduction of replacement, test and repair strategy. In particular, single crossover, uniform crossover and rank based selection schemes were employed. The timetabling system was subjected to five different mutation rates: 0.02, 0.04, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50. The results of the experiment revealed that best and feasible timetable was generated at the least considered mutation rate of 0.02 and fitness function of 0.95. None of the hard constraints were violated, so the timetable generated was feasible. Also, it was discovered mutation rate has greater effect on feasible timetable generation; no conflict of courses was experience when mutation rate was reduced to 0.02."

The studied university course timetabling problem involves hard constraints such as classroom, class curriculum, and other variables. Concurrently, some soft constraints need also to be considered, including teacher’s preferred time, favorite class time etc. These preferences correspond to satisfaction values obtained via questionnaires. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a promising scheme for solving NP-complete problems due to its fast convergence, fewer parameter settings and ability to fit dynamic environmental characteristics. Therefore, PSO was applied towards solving course timetabling problems in this work. To reduce the computational complexity, a timeslot was designated in a particle’s encoding as the scheduling unit. Two types of PSO, the inertia weight version and constriction version, were evaluated. Moreover, an interchange heuristic was utilized to explore the neighboring solution space to improve solution quality. Additionally, schedule conflicts are handled after a solution has been generated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme of constriction PSO with interchange heuristic is able to generate satisfactory course timetables that meet the requirements of teachers and classes according to the various applied constraints."

The solution of one ILP is obtained by using a column generation procedure. Experimental results show that the proposed lower bound is often better than the ones found by the previous methods in the literature, and also much better than those found by other new ILP formulations illustrated in this paper. The proposed approach is able to obtain improved lower bounds on real-world benchmark instances from the literature, used in the international timetabling competitions ITC2002 and ITC2007, proving for the first time that some of the best-known heuristic solutions are indeed optimal (or close to the optimal ones)."

    abstract = "Finding a good university timetabling system is not a simple task for a higher educational organisation. As a result, many approaches to generating sufficiently good solutions have been introduced. This is mainly due to the high complexity within the search landscape; moreover, each educational organisation has its own rules and specifications. In this paper, a Tabu-based memetic algorithm that hybridises a genetic algorithm with a Tabu Search algorithm is proposed as an improved algorithm for university timetabling problems. This algorithm is employed on a set of neighbourhood structures during the search process with the aim of gaining significant improvements in solution quality. The sequence of neighbourhood structures has been considered to understand its effect on the search space. Random, best and general sequences of neighbourhood structures have been evaluated in this work. The concept of a Tabu list is embedded to control the selection of neighbourhood structures that are not dependent on the problem domains during the optimisation process after the crossover and mutation operators are applied to the selected solutions from the population pool. The algorithm will penalise neighbourhood structures that are unable to generate better solutions. The proposed algorithm has been applied and evaluated against the latest methodologies in the literature with respect to standard benchmark problems. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces some of the best known results when tested on ITC2007 competition datasets."

One of the most mentioned difficult nature of the problem is context dependent which changes even from departments to departments. Different heuristic approaches have been proposed in order to solve this kind of problem in the literature. One of the efficient solution methods for this problem is tabu search. Different neighborhood structures based on different types of move have been defined in studies using tabu search. In this paper, the effects of moves called simple and swap on the operation of tabu search are examined based on defined neighborhood structures. Also, two new neighborhood structures are proposed by using the moves called simple and swap. The fall semester of course timetabling problem of the Department of Statistics at Hacettepe University is solved utilizing four neighborhood structures and the comparison of the results obtained from these structures is given"

The problem of assigning lecturers, rooms, and courses to fixed timeslots, normally, a week, while satisfying a number of problem-specific constraints was modeled as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP). The problem constraints have been divided into hard constraints and soft constraints. While the hard constraints constitute the problem constraints, the minimization of the violation of the soft constraints constitutes the objective function. Being an NP-Hard problem, a heuristic was developed and implemented manually. Ten (10) solutions were generated manually from 10 runs with the newly developed search technique. An analysis of the performance of the solutions shows that the proposed heuristic is promising."

In this problem, there may be multiple classes of each subject, and the decision on which students are to constitute each class is made in concert with the decision on the timetable for each class. In order to solve this problem, it is normally simplified or decomposed in some fashion. One simplification commonly used in practice is known as blocking: it is assumed that the classes can be partitioned into sets of classes (or blocks) that will be timetabled in parallel. This restricts clashing to occur only between classes in the same block, and essentially removes the timetabling aspect of the problem, which can be carried out once the blocks are constituted and the classes populated. The problem of constituting the blocks and populating the classes, known as the course blocking and population problem is nevertheless a challenging problem, and provides the focus of this paper. We demonstrate, using data provided by a local high school, that integer linear programming approaches can solve the problem in a matter of seconds. Key features include remodelling to remove symmetry caused by students with identical subject selection, and the observation that in practice, only integrality of the block composition variables needs to be enforced; the class population aspects of the model have strong integrality properties."

The primary purpose of this paper is to solve an existing course scheduling prob-lem. Organizing courses and lectures according to periods and avail-ability of classrooms is a difficult course scheduling problem, which we are currently experiencing within the Department of Statistics at Gazi University. We have therefore formulated the problem as a 0-1 inte-ger programming model.

An improvement approach is employed in phase 2 using a randomised iterative algorithm with a composite neighbourhood structure and a simulated annealing based acceptance criterion. In phase 3, a hill climbing approach is implemented in an attempt to further improve the solution. The approach is tested on eleven established datasets.

This paper describes the Stochastic Optimisation Timetabling Tool (SOTT) that has been developed for university course timetabling. Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and random search are embedded in the SOTT. The algorithms include a repair process, which ensures that all infeasible timetables are rectified. This prevents clashes and ensures that the rooms are sufficiently large to accommodate the classes. The algorithms also evaluate timetables in terms of soft constraints: minimising student movement; avoiding fragmentation in the timetables for students and lecturers; and satisfying lecturers’ preferences for the timing of classes. The algorithms were tested using two sets of timetabling data from a collaborating university. Both GA and SA produced very good timetables, but the results obtained from SA were slightly better than those using GA. However, the GA was 54% faster than SA."

For a solution to be feasible, a number of hard constraints must be satisfied. The quality of the solution is measured in terms of a penalty value which represents the degree to which various soft constraints are satisfied. This hybrid evolutionary approach is tested over established datasets and compared against state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. The results obtained confirm that the approach is able to produce solutions to the course timetabling problem which exhibit some of the lowest penalty values in the literature on these benchmark problems. It is therefore concluded that the hybrid evolutionary approach represents a particularly effective methodology for producing high quality solutions to the university course timetabling problem."

The model aims to enhance existing manual scheduling and timetabling approaches that are often accompanied with arduous combinatorial tasks such as resolving class conflicts, dealing with parking and traffic congestion, and ensuring an efficient utilization of facility and human resources. This modeling approach emphasizes the generation of flexible class timetables for students, and the efficient utilization of available facility resources.

The two most important aspects consist in permitting multiple cumulative resources as well as negative heights for the resource consumption of the tasks. This allows modeling in an easy way workload covering, producer-consumer, and scheduling problems. The introduction of negative heights has forced us to come up with new filtering algorithms and to revisit existing ones. The first filtering algorithm is derived from an idea called sweep, which is extensively used in computational geometry; the second algorithm is based on a combination of sweep and constructive disjunction; while the last is a generalization of task intervals to this new context. A real-life crew scheduling problem originally motivated this constraint which was implemented within the SICStus finite domain solver and evaluated against different problem patterns."
