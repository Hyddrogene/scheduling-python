\subsection{Solutions}
\label{sec:solution}

The solution schema is used to encode
any solution pre-computed for an instance.
%(e.g., the choice of rooms and start times for sessions).
Such a solution needs not be complete, nor consistent with the instance constraints.
An instance may hence be associated with any kind of input solution based on the
computational task,
e.g. no solution at all when generating a timetable from scratch, 
a resource allocation solution to extend into a complete timetable,
a seed solution to improve, 
or an inconsistent solution to repair.
Formally, the solution schema
supports the representation of
any decision made for a session
as to its start time,
% on time points ($\var{\SESSION}{\SLOT}{s}$),
its set of rooms
%($\var{\SESSION}{\ROOM}{s}$)
and its set of teachers.
%($\var{\SESSION}{\TEACHER}{s}$)
%for sessions.
