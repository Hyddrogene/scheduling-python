  abstract = "This paper presents a new cumulatives constraint, which generalizes the original cumulative constraint in different ways. The two most important aspects consist in permitting multiple cumulative resources as well as negative heights for the resource consumption of the tasks. This allows modeling in an easy way workload covering, producer-consumer, and scheduling problems. The introduction of negative heights has forced us to come up with new filtering algorithms and to revisit existing ones. The first filtering algorithm is derived from an idea called sweep, which is extensively used in computational geometry; the second algorithm is based on a combination of sweep and constructive disjunction; while the last is a generalization of task intervals to this new context. A real-life crew scheduling problem originally motivated this constraint which was implemented within the SICStus finite domain solver and evaluated against different problem patterns.",

abstract = "At universities, the timetable plays a large role in the daily life of students and staff, showing when and where lectures are given. But whenever a schedule is executed in a dynamic environment, disruptions will occur. It is then desirable to find a new timetable similar to the old one, so only a few people will be affected. This leads to a minimum perturbation problem, where the goal is to find a feasible timetable by changing as few assignments as possible. This solution will, however, often lead to timetables of low quality as it can have many undesired features that will cause much inconvenience for effected parties. In this paper we show that minimum perturbation solutions often have low quality and how using additional perturbations results in timetables with significantly higher quality while still keeping the number of perturbations low, so the solutions can be practically implemented. We formulate a bi-objective model and propose a method to solve it by using mixed integer programming. We test the method on standard instances of the Curriculum-based Course Timetabling Problem with four different types of disruptions. The use of bi-objective optimization enables us to generate multiple solutions whereby we provide the decision makers with multiple choices for handling the disruption. This allows the decision makers to determine the best trade-off between the number of perturbations and the quality, ultimately leading to better timetables for students and staff when disruptions occur."

abstract="Constraint-Based Local Search emerged in the last decade as a framework for declaratively expressing hard combinatorial optimization problems and solve them with local search techniques. It delivers tools to practitioners that enables them to quickly experiment with multiple models, heuristics, and meta-heuristics, focusing on their application rather than the delicate minutiae of producing a competitive implementation. At its heart, the declarative models are reminiscent of the modeling facilities familiar to constraint programming, while the underlying computational model heavily depends on incrementality. The net result is a platform capable of delivering competitive local search solutions at a fraction of the efforts needed with a conventional approach delivering model-and-run to local search users.",

LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of ``related'' customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems",

QCSP offers a natural framework to express PSPACE problems as finite two-players games. But to define a QCSP model, the binder must be formerly known and cannot be built dynamically even if the worst case won{\textquoteright}t occur. To overcome this issue, we define the new QCHR formalism that allows to build the binder dynamically during the solving. Our QCHR models exhibit state-of-the-art performances on static binder and outperforms previous QCSP approaches when the binder is dynamic.</p>

It is a very hard combinatorial optimisation problem which attracts the interest of many researchers. The university course timetabling problem (UCTTP) is difficult to address due to the size of the problem and several challenging hard and soft constraints. Over the years, various methodologies were proposed to solve UCTTP. The purpose of this survey paper is to provide the most recent scientific review of the methodologies applied to UCTTP. The paper unveils a classification of methodologies proposed in recent years based on chronology and datasets used. Perspectives, trends, challenges and opportunities in UCTTP are also presented. It is observed that meta-heuristic approaches are popular among researchers. This is followed closely by hybrid methodologies. Hyper-heuristic approaches are also able to produce effective results. Another observation is that the state-of-art methodologies in the scientific literature are not fully utilised in a real-world environment perhaps due to the limited flexibility of these methodologies.},

Generally, researchers present different features to signify their own universities’ timetable according to the structure and behavior of their institution. However, the gap between theory and real-world applications that can be seen in the resulted timetable is the lacking of acknowledging human preferences. As to overcome this, it is very important to consider all the demands and preferences from timetabling community. This research therefore tries to accommodate the problem by investigating through surveys to several universities in the east coast of Malaysia the demands and preferences of individuals involved directly. Results from the questionnaires will be analyzed by using SPSS and all current issues regarding the demands will be included into our existing general university course timetabling mathematical model. The new university course timetabling mathematical model could best represent universities and be useful, especially in universities in Malaysia.},

Hyper-heuristics have been successfully applied to a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This is a rapidly growing field which aims at providing generalized solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by exploring a heuristic space instead of a solution space. From the research conducted thus far it is evident that hyper-heuristics are effective at solving educational timetabling problems and have the potential of advancing this field by providing a generalized solution to educational timetabling as a whole. Given this, the paper provides an overview and critical analysis of hyper-heuristics for educational timetabling and proposes future research directions, focusing on using hyper-heuristics to provide a generalized solution to educational timetabling.},

Constructing an effective timetable is always a challenging task for any scheduler. Most literature research focuses on specific applications and the resulting models are not easily applied to problems other than those for which they were designed for. In this paper, we construct a general model for university course timetabling. Our model incorporates a total of 17 different types of requirements identified in the literature as well as three new constraint types that we think should be part of the restrictions in a general university based timetabling model. An integer programming (IP) model is presented which incorporates restrictions that need to be satisfied and requests that are included in the objective function. We implement and test our models using the AIMMS mathematical software package. Computational results on a number of case studies are favorable and demonstrate the value of our approach.},

We formulate the problem as a mathematical programming model. Two diﬀerent algorithms, mainly based on simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) algorithms, are proposed for solving the problem. The proposed algorithms consist of two phases. The ﬁrst phase involves allocating the teachers to the courses and determining the number of courses to be assigned to each teacher. The second phase involves assigning the teachers to the course sections in order to balance the teachers’ load. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using two sets of real data and some randomly generated problem instances. The computational results show that in general, tabu search performs better than simulated annealing and other previous work. For the real data sets, the computational results show that both proposed algorithms yield better solutions when compared to manual allocation done by the university.},

Variables of the underlying mathematical model correspond to daily teacher schedules while a number of hard and soft constraints are included so as for the model to handle practical aspects that manifest themselves in Greek High Schools. By selecting better teacher schedules that exist in sub- problems the quality of the overall solution gradually improves. The collected results which are obtained within reasonable time are most promising.

	abstract = {The Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem (BACP) consists in assigning courses to teaching terms satisfying prerequisites and balancing the credit course load within each term. The BACP is part of the CSPLib with three benchmark instances, but its formulation is simpler than the problem solved in practice by universities. In this article, we introduce a generalized version of the problem that takes different curricula and professor preferences into account, and we provide a set of real-life problem instances arisen at University of Udine. Since the existing formulation based on a min–max objective function does not balance effectively the credit load for the new instances, we also propose alternative objective functions. Whereas all the CSPLib instances are efficiently solved with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) state-of-the-art solvers, our new set of real-life instances turns out to be much more challenging and still intractable for ILP solvers. Therefore, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed heuristics based on local search. We have collected computational results on all the new instances with the proposed approaches and assessed the quality of solutions with respect to the lower bounds found by ILP on a relaxed and decomposed problem. Results show that a selected heuristic finds solutions of quality at 9\%–60\% distance from the lower bound. We make all data publicly available, in order to stimulate further research on this problem.},

In the first stage, Tabu Search with Sampling and Perturbation (TSSP) is used to generate feasible solutions. In the second stage, we propose an improved variant of Simulated Annealing (SA), which we call Simulated Annealing with Reheating (SAR), to improve the solution quality of feasible solutions. SAR has three features: a novel neighborhood examination scheme, a new way of estimating local optima and a reheating scheme. SAR eliminates the need for extensive tuning as is often required in conventional SA. The proposed methodologies are tested on the three most studied datasets from the scientific literature. Our algorithms perform well and our results are competitive, if not better, compared to the benchmarks set by the state of the art methods. New best known results are provided for many instances.},

Further tests on randomly created instances show that the model can be used to address cases of broad interest.

doi = {10.1007/s10951-020-00666-3},
abstract = {Solving university course timetabling problems is a large and complex task. Moreover, every new academic term, a new
timetable is likely to be scheduled due to disruptions (e.g., changes in teacher-lecture allocation). Nevertheless, the university
infrastructure, the overall curricular plans, and the number of students/teachers is still very similar in consecutive terms. For
this reason, a timetable does not need to be always scheduled from scratch since it can produce a completely different solution
from the previous one, thus creating undesirable changes for many actors. This paper addresses the Minimal Perturbation
Problem (MPP) in university course timetabling. Given a set of disruptions that make a timetable no longer feasible, a solution
to the MPP is the closest new feasible timetable with respect to the original timetable. We propose and analyze two different
integer programming models to encode the MPP. To validate the proposed models, disruptions are randomly generated based
on the probability distributions learned from the history of timetables over the last five years in the Instituto Superior Técnico
(IST) the engineering school from Universidade de Lisboa. Overall, our models, combined with an incremental approach, are
shown to be able to efficiently solve all problem instances.},

Timetabling is the type of problems where the events need to be organized into a number of timeslots to prevent the conflicts in using a given set of resources. Thus in the intervening decades, significant progress has been made in the course timetabling problem monitoring with metaheuristic adjustment. In this study, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm approach has been developed for university course timetabling problem. ACO is believed to be a powerful solution approach for various combinatorial optimization problems. This approach is used according to the data set instances that have been collected. Its performance is presented using the appropriate algorithm. The results are arguably within the best results range from the literature. The performance assessment and results are used to determine whether they are reliable in preparing a qualifying course timetabling process.}

This paper presents an Adaptive Tabu Search algorithm (denoted by ATS) for solving a problem of curriculum-based course timetabling. The proposed algorithm follows a general framework composed of three phases: initialization, intensification and diversification. The initialization phase constructs a feasible initial timetable using a fast greedy heuristic. Then an adaptively combined intensification and diversification phase is used to reduce the number of soft constraint violations while maintaining the satisfaction of hard constraints. The proposed ATS algorithm integrates several distinguished features such as an original double Kempe chains neighborhood structure, a penalty-guided perturbation operator and an adaptive search mechanism. Computational results show the high effectiveness of the proposed ATS algorithm, compared with five reference algorithms as well as the current best known results. This paper also shows an analysis to explain which are the essential ingredients of the ATS algorithm.}

The common problems are that a lecturer is scheduled in the same time slot, or several courses are scheduled in the same room and the same time slot. For this reason, scheduling needs to be made in such a way that it can optimize the use of resources. We use simulated annealing as an approach to solve that problem. The results showed that the higher the initial temperature value used and the greater the iteration value would reduce the violation constraints in scheduling problems.}

abstract={University course timetabling covers the task of assigning rooms and time periods to courses while ensuring a minimum violation of soft constraints that define the quality of the timetable. These soft constraints can have attributes that make it difficult for mixed-integer programming solvers to find good solutions fast enough to be used in a practical setting. Therefore, metaheuristics have dominated this area despite the fact that mixed-integer programming solvers have improved tremendously over the last decade. This paper presents a matheuristic where the MIP-solver is guided to find good feasible solutions faster. This makes the matheuristic applicable in practical settings, where mixed-integer programming solvers do not perform well. To the best of our knowledge this is the first matheuristic presented for the University Course Timetabling problem. The matheuristic works as a large neighborhood search where the MIP solver is used to explore a part of the solution space in each iteration. The matheuristic uses problem specific knowledge to fix a number of variables and create smaller problems for the solver to work on, and thereby iteratively improves the solution. Thus we are able to solve very large instances and retrieve good solutions within reasonable time limits. The presented framework is easily extendable due to the flexibility of modeling with MIPs; new constraints and objectives can be added without the need to alter the algorithm itself. At the same time, the matheuristic will benefit from future improvements of MIP solvers. The matheuristic is benchmarked on instances from the literature and the 2nd International Timetabling Competition (ITC2007). Our algorithm gives better solutions than running a state-of-the-art MIP solver directly on the model, especially on larger and more constrained instances. Compared to the winner of ITC2007, the matheuristic performs better. However, the most recent state-of-the-art metaheuristics outperform the matheuristic.}

These constraints are often encountered in the fields of scheduling, packing, layout, and mining. Alone, small-neighborhood local search algorithms encounter difficulties on these problems. Indeed, moving from a good solution to another requires small changes on many variables, due to the tight satisfaction of the constraints. The solution we implemented in LocalSolver is a kind of constraint propagation: when the solution obtained after a local transformation is infeasible, we gradually repair it, one constraint at a time. In order to extend the local transformation rather than cancel it, we impose never to go back on the decision to increase or decrease the value of a variable. We show that the success of this repair procedure is guaranteed for a large class of constraints. We apply this method to several scheduling problems, characterized by precedences and disjunctive resource constraints. We give numerical results on the Job Shop, Open Shop and Unit Commitment Problems, and show that our repair algorithm dramatically improves the performance of our local search algorithms.}

This paper considers vectors of bits. Such data structures implement entities as diverse as bitmaps that indicate the occurrences of terms and bitstrings indicating the presence of edges in images. For such applications, a popular distance measure is the Hamming distance. The value of the Hamming distance for information retrieval applications is limited by the fact that it counts only exact matches, whereas in information retrieval, corresponding bits that are close by can still be considered to be almost identical. We define a “Generalized Hamming distance” that extends the Hamming concept to give partial credit for near misses, and suggest a dynamic programming algorithm that permits it to be computed efficiently. We envision many uses for such a measure. In this paper we define and prove some basic properties of the “Generalized Hamming distance”, and illustrate its use in the area of object recognition. We evaluate our implementation in a series of experiments, using autonomous robots to test the measure's effectiveness in relating similar bitstrings.},

  journal={Annals of Operations Research},
  year={2016},
  abstract={In this paper we present a general integer programming-based approach for the minimal perturbation problem in university course timetabling. This problem arises when an existing timetable contains hard constraint violations, or infeasibilities, which need to be resolved. The objective is to resolve these infeasibilities while minimising the disruption or perturbation to the remainder of the timetable. This situation commonly occurs in practical timetabling, for example when there are unexpected changes to course enrolments or available rooms. Our method attempts to resolve each infeasibility in the smallest neighbourhood possible, by utilising the exactness of integer programming. Operating within a neighbourhood of minimal size keeps the computations fast, and does not permit large movements of course events, which cause widespread disruption to timetable structure. We demonstrate the application of this method using examples based on real data from the University of Auckland},

  journal={Constraints},
  year={2011},
  volume={16},
  abstract={It is often the case that after a scheduling problem has been solved some small changes occur that make the solution of the original problem not valid. Solving the new problem from scratch can result in a schedule that is very different from the original schedule. In applications such as a university course timetable or flight scheduling, one would be interested in a solution that requires minimal changes for the users. The present paper considers the minimal perturbation problem. It is motivated by scenarios in which a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is subject to changes. In particular, the case where some of the constraints are changed after a solution was obtained. The goal is to find a solution to the changed problem that is as similar as possible (e.g. includes minimal perturbations) to the previous solution. Previous studies proposed a formal model for this problem (Barták et al. 2004), a best first search algorithm (Ross et al. 2000), complexity bounds (Hebrard et al. 2005), and branch and bound based algorithms (Barták et al. 2004; Hebrard et al. 2005). The present paper proposes a new approach for solving the minimal perturbation problem. The proposed method interleaves constraint optimization and constraint satisfaction techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over former algorithms. Experiments were performed both on random CSPs and on random instances of the Meeting Scheduling Problem.},

abstract = {The high school timetabling is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that takes a large number of variables and constraints into account. Due to its combinatorial nature, solving medium and large instances to optimality is a challenging task. When resources are tight, it is often difficult to find even a feasible solution. Among the different requirements that are considered in Brazilian schools, two compactness requirements must be met on a teacher׳s schedule: the minimization of working days and the avoidance of idle timeslots. In this paper, we present a mixed integer linear programming model and a fix-and-optimize heuristic combined with a variable neighborhood descent method. Our method uses three different types of decompositions - class, teacher and day – in order to solve the high school timetabling problem. The method is able to find new best known solutions for seven instances, including three optimal ones. A comparison with results reported in the literature shows that the proposed fix-and-optimize heuristic outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for the resolution of the problem at hand.}

We developed a Column Generation algorithm based on a pattern formulation of the time scheduling part of the problem by Bagger et al. (2016). The pattern formulation is an enumeration of all schedules by which each course can be assigned on each day; it is a lower bounding model. Pattern enumeration has also been considered in Burke (2008), where the authors enumerated all schedules to which each curriculum can be assigned on each day. We applied the Dantzig–Wolfe reformulation, so each column corresponded to a schedule for an entire day. We solved the reformulation with the Column Generation algorithm, where each pricing problem generated a full schedule for a single day. We provided a pre-processing technique that, on average, removed approximately 45\% of the pattern variables in the pricing problems. We then extended the pre-processing technique into inequalities that we added to the model. Lastly, we describe how we applied Local Branching to the pricing problem by using the columns generated in previous iterations. We compare the lower bounds we obtained, with other methods from literature, on 20 data instances of real-world applications. For 16 instances the optimal solutions are known, but the remaining four are still open. Our approach improved the best-known lower bound for all four open instances, and decreased the average gap from 24 to 11\%.}

Meta-heuristic approaches have been commonly applied to this problem in the literature and have achieved high performance on benchmark datasets. This survey paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of these approaches in the UCTP. It reviews, summarizes, and categorizes the approaches, and introduces a classification for hybrid meta-heuristic methods. Furthermore, it critically analyzes the benefits and limitations of the methods. It also presents challenges, gaps, and possible future work.}

At each iteration, the neighborhood size is changed simply by constructing a random partial neighborhood, which is defined as a random subset of the entire neighborhood. The main reason for using a random partial neighborhood is to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during search, and two updating strategies are considered for changing the neighborhood size. The proposed algorithms were tested using well-known benchmark sets and the results obtained were highly competitive with those produced by the leading solvers developed for these benchmark sets.}

As a result, many approaches to generating sufficiently good solutions have been introduced. This is mainly due to the high complexity within the search landscape; moreover, each educational organisation has its own rules and specifications. In this paper, a Tabu-based memetic algorithm that hybridises a genetic algorithm with a Tabu Search algorithm is proposed as an improved algorithm for university timetabling problems. This algorithm is employed on a set of neighbourhood structures during the search process with the aim of gaining significant improvements in solution quality. The sequence of neighbourhood structures has been considered to understand its effect on the search space. Random, best and general sequences of neighbourhood structures have been evaluated in this work. The concept of a Tabu list is embedded to control the selection of neighbourhood structures that are not dependent on the problem domains during the optimisation process after the crossover and mutation operators are applied to the selected solutions from the population pool. The algorithm will penalise neighbourhood structures that are unable to generate better solutions. The proposed algorithm has been applied and evaluated against the latest methodologies in the literature with respect to standard benchmark problems. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces some of the best known results when tested on ITC2007 competition datasets.}

abstract = {Feature models are arguably one of the most intuitive and successful notations for modeling the features of a variant-rich software system. Feature models help developers to keep an overall understanding of the system, and also support scoping, planning, development, variant derivation, configuration, and maintenance activities that sustain the system's long-term success. Unfortunately, feature models are difficult to build and evolve. Features need to be identified, grouped, organized in a hierarchy, and mapped to software assets. Also, dependencies between features need to be declared. While feature models have been the subject of three decades of research, resulting in many feature-modeling notations together with automated analysis and configuration techniques, a generic set of principles for engineering feature models is still missing. It is not even clear whether feature models could be engineered using recurrent principles. Our work shows that such principles in fact exist. We analyzed feature-modeling practices elicited from ten interviews conducted with industrial practitioners and from 31 relevant papers. We synthesized a set of 34 principles covering eight different phases of feature modeling, from planning over model construction, to model maintenance and evolution. Grounded in empirical evidence, these principles provide practical, context-specific advice on how to perform feature modeling, describe what information sources to consider, and highlight common characteristics of feature models. We believe that our principles can support researchers and practitioners enhancing feature-modeling tooling, synthesis, and analyses techniques, as well as scope future research.},
